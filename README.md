###EDA_analysis_zomato 

## Overview  
This project aims to conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset. The primary goal is to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights. Through various statistical and visualization techniques, we examine relationships between different features, detect anomalies, and identify patterns that can provide valuable information for further decision-making and predictive modeling.  

## Steps Performed  

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration  
- The dataset is loaded using `pandas.read_csv()` while ensuring proper encoding.  
- Initial inspection of the dataset is performed using:  
  - `df.head()` and `df.tail()` to view sample records.  
  - `df.info()` to check column types and detect missing values.  
  - `df.describe()` to generate summary statistics for numerical features.  
- Identifying unique values in categorical columns to understand feature diversity.  

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- **Handling Missing Values**:  
  - Categorical columns are filled with the mode (most frequently occurring value).  
  - Numerical columns are imputed using the median to minimize distortion.  
- **Detecting and Removing Duplicates**:  
  - Duplicate entries are identified and removed using `df.drop_duplicates()`.  
- **Outlier Detection & Treatment**:  
  - The IQR (Interquartile Range) method is used to detect extreme values.  
  - Outliers are either capped within a reasonable range or removed based on data relevance.  
- **Standardizing Categorical Data**:  
  - Text values are converted to lowercase and stripped of unnecessary spaces to maintain consistency.  
  - Categories with similar meanings are merged where applicable.  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
EDA is performed to understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the dataset.  

- **Univariate Analysis** (Analyzing individual variables):  
  - Histograms and bar charts are used to examine distributions of numerical and categorical variables.  
  - Box plots help identify potential outliers.  
  - Count plots are used for categorical data to show frequency distributions.  

- **Bivariate Analysis** (Exploring relationships between two variables):  
  - Scatter plots and line plots help visualize numerical feature interactions.  
  - Box plots illustrate differences between categories (e.g., ratings across different price levels).  
  - Heatmaps display correlations between numerical variables, helping to identify strong relationships.  

- **Multivariate Analysis** (Examining multiple features together):  
  - Pair plots provide a detailed comparison of multiple numeric features simultaneously.  
  - Grouped bar charts and violin plots help analyze category-wise trends.  
  - Cross-tabulations assist in understanding dependencies between categorical variables.  

### 4. Data Visualization  
To make insights more interpretable, we use the following visualization techniques:  

- **Heatmaps**: Highlight correlations among numerical features.  
- **Box Plots**: Showcase cost and rating distributions, along with outliers.  
- **Scatter Plots**: Help analyze trends between key numeric variables.  
- **Pair Plots**: Provide an overview of relationships between multiple numeric features.  
- **Distribution Plots**: Depict the spread of numerical values in the dataset.  
- **Bar Charts**: Display categorical data frequency and ranking.  

## Key Insights  
- Certain variables, such as price and ratings, exhibit a strong correlation, but other factors also influence user reviews.  
- Outlier detection and handling are crucial to maintaining data consistency.  
- Popular trends and customer preferences can be inferred by analyzing categorical distributions.  
- Visualization helps in identifying patterns that are not easily noticeable from raw data.  

## Summary  
This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project follows a structured approach to processing, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset. By applying statistical methods and visualization techniques, we extract meaningful insights that help in data-driven decision-making. The insights from this analysis can further be utilized for predictive modeling, trend analysis, and business intelligence applications.
